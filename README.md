The Voting System project is a comprehensive solution that enables individuals to participate in voting processes seamlessly. It offers both online and offline options to cater to a wide range of users. The system provides a simple offline interface using the "printf" function, while the online section prompts users to enter their unique identification number (ID) and presents a list of predefined candidates for voting. It also incorporates several additional features such as preventing duplicate votes, displaying vote counts, determining the percentage of votes with respect to the population, and identifying the leading candidate.

<h2>Online Section:</h2>
<p>
  The online section of the Voting System project provides a more interactive voting experience. Users are prompted to enter their unique identification number (ID) to authenticate their eligibility to vote. Once the ID is verified, the system displays a list of predefined candidates or options, along with relevant information about each candidate. Users can then make their selection by choosing the desired candidate.

<h2>Duplicate Vote Prevention:</h2>
To ensure the integrity of the voting process, the system includes a duplicate vote prevention mechanism. If a user attempts to cast their vote again using the same ID, the system promptly informs them that they have already voted and restricts them from submitting another vote.

<h2>Vote Count:</h2>
The Voting System project also incorporates a vote count feature. It maintains a record of all the votes cast and keeps track of the number of votes each candidate receives. This allows users and administrators to monitor the progress of the voting process in real-time and obtain accurate statistics.

<h2>Vote Percentage with Respect to Population:</h2>
Another notable feature of the Voting System project is the ability to calculate the vote percentage with respect to the population. By retrieving the total population data, the system can determine the percentage of votes received by each candidate, providing valuable insights into their popularity among the voters.

<h2>Leading Candidate:</h2>
The Voting System project identifies the leading candidate based on the vote count. It determines the candidate who has received the highest number of votes and displays this information to the users. This feature allows users to stay updated on the current standings and helps in evaluating the candidate's performance during the election.

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
Overall, the Voting System project offers a user-friendly and efficient solution for conducting voting processes. It seamlessly integrates offline and online options, prevents duplicate votes, provides real-time vote count and percentage data, and identifies the leading candidate. This project aims to streamline the voting experience while ensuring transparency and accuracy in the election process.
